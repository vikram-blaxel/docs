<Note>
  This feature is currently in private alpha preview. It is currently only available for sandboxes in the `us-was-1` region. [Request access](https://blaxel.ai/contact?message=I%20want%20to%20get%20preview%20access%20to%20dedicated%20egress%20IPs%20for%20the%20following%20use%20case%3A ).
</Note>

Dedicated egress IP addresses enable customers to exclusively attach IP addresses to resources within their workspace. This makes it possible to whitelist outbound traffic from Blaxel's systems for use in downstream providers and eliminates the need for workarounds such as self-hosted proxy servers or VPNs.

A single egress IP address supports up to 32,000 resources (sandboxes, workloads, etc.) It is also possible to group IP addresses into pools to automatically load-balance outbound traffic for high-demand workloads.

Resources that do not have a dedicated egress IP pool will use the shared [public IP address pool](./Regions#public-ip-addresses) instead.

## Order an egress IP address

Egress IP address configuration takes place from the [Blaxel Console](https://app.blaxel.ai).

- Navigate to **Network** > **Egress IPs**.
- Click the **Order IP** button in the top right corner.

- Select the quantity, existing IP address pool (if any) and egress gateway region.

Provisioning is automated and typically completes within a few minutes. In case the IP address is not already assigned to a dedicated pool, a new pool will be created.

Once provisioning is complete, you can attach the assigned IP addresses to one or more resources. All outbound traffic from those resources will then originate from this unique address.
