<Note>
  This feature is currently in private alpha preview. [Request access](https://blaxel.ai/contact?message=I%20want%20to%20get%20preview%20access%20to%20dedicated%20egress%20IPs%20for%20the%20following%20use%20case%3A ).
</Note>


<Note>
  Dedicated egress IP addresses are currently only available for sandboxes in the `` region.
</Note>

Resources that do not have a dedicated egress IP pool will use the shared [public IP address pool](./Regions#public-ip-addresses) instead.
