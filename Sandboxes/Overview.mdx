---

Sandboxes are instant-launching virtual machines serving as **sandboxed compute runtimes for agents**. You can securely run LLM-generated code inside these VMs making them ideal for agents that need access to an operating system to run commands with no risk of escaping.

They provide a basic [REST API interface](https://docs.blaxel.ai/api-reference/filesystem) for accessing the file system and processes, along with an [MCP server](./MCP) that makes these capabilities available as tool calls.

Unlike traditional sandbox infrastructure, Blaxel's **standout feature** is fully managed lifecycle. Sandboxes resume from standby in **under 25 milliseconds** and automatically scale to zero **after a few seconds of inactivity**. This means that your sandboxes wait on standby indefinitely when not used, eliminating cold starts without complex orchestration. Memory state is maintained even after scaling down, including the running processes and entire filesystem. For cost-effective long-term persistence, you can attach [volumes](Volumes) to sandboxes.

In addition to automatic scale-to-zero, Blaxel also supports [automatic sandbox deletion based on expiration policies](./Expiration). Starter quotas enforce time-to-live (TTLs), while higher quota tiers unlock sandboxes with unlimited persistence.

## Use cases

Some examples of use cases include:

- **Code review agents** that analyze repositories to detect the effects of changes. These agents run fully isolated compute environments for each tenant while keeping them snapshotted in standby between sessions, eliminating the need to clone the repo every time.
- **Code generation agents** that iterate in their own compute environments, and instantly render live application previews as human users build, step away, and log back in.
- **Data analyst agents** that execute adhoc data analysis workflows, generating scripts on-the-fly and running them securely against private files or data within an isolated, ZDR-compliant environment.
- **Background agents** that operate beyond their pre-configured tools. Each agent gets its own "personal computer" where it can autonomously install packages, execute custom scripts, store files, and adapt to new requirements securely. They can parallelize dozens of those personal computers.

## Create a sandbox

### Using the SDKs

Create a new sandbox using the [Blaxel SDK](../sdk-reference/introduction) by specifying a name, image to use, optional [deployment region](../Infrastructure/Regions), optional labels, and the ports to expose. Note that **ports** **80** (system), and **443** & **8080** (sandbox API) are reserved by Blaxel.

<Accordion title="Set up authentication to Blaxel">
  The Blaxel SDK authenticates with your workspace using credentials from these sources, in priority order:

  1. when running on Blaxel, authentication is handled automatically
  2. variables in your `.env` file (`BL_WORKSPACE` and `BL_API_KEY`, or see [this page](../Agents/Variables-and-secrets) for other authentication options).
  3. environment variables from your machine
  4. configuration file created locally when you log in through [Blaxel CLI](../cli-reference/introduction) (or deploy on Blaxel)

  When developing locally, the recommended method is to just **log in to your workspace with Blaxel CLI.** This allows you to run Blaxel SDK functions that will automatically connect to your workspace without additional setup. When you deploy on Blaxel, this connection persists automatically.

  When running Blaxel SDK from a remote server that is not Blaxel-hosted, we recommend using environment variables as described in the third option above.
</Accordion>

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
import { SandboxInstance } from "@blaxel/core";

// Create a new sandbox
const sandbox = await SandboxInstance.create({
  name: "my-sandbox",
  image: "blaxel/base-image:latest",   // public or custom image
  memory: 4096,   // in MB
  ports: [{ target: 3000, protocol: "HTTP" }],   // optional; ports to expose
  labels: { env: "dev", project: "my-project" }, // optional; labels
  region: "us-pdx-1"   // optional; if not specified, Blaxel will choose a default region
});
```


```python Python
import asyncio
from blaxel.core import SandboxInstance

async def main():

    # Create a new sandbox
    sandbox = await SandboxInstance.create({
      "name": "my-sandbox",
      "image": "blaxel/base-image:latest",   # public or custom image
      "memory": 4096,   # in MB
      "ports": [{ "target": 3000 }],   # optional; ports to expose
      "labels": {"env": "dev", "project": "my-project"},  # optional; labels
      "region": "us-pdx-1"   # optional; if not specified, Blaxel will choose a default region
    })

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

</CodeGroup>

An alternative is to use the helper function `createIfNotExists()` (TypeScript) / `create_if_not_exists()` (Python). This helper function either retrieves an existing sandbox or creates a new one if it doesn't exist. Blaxel first checks for an existing sandbox with the provided `name` and either retrieves it or creates a new one using your specified configuration.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
import { SandboxInstance } from "@blaxel/core";

// Create sandbox if it doesn't exist
const sandbox = await SandboxInstance.createIfNotExists({
  name: "my-sandbox",
  image: "blaxel/base-image:latest",  // public or custom image
  memory: 4096,    // in MB
  ports: [{ target: 3000, protocol: "HTTP" }],  // optional; ports to expose
  labels: { env: "dev", project: "my-project" }, // optional; labels
  region: "us-pdx-1"    // optional; if not specified, Blaxel will choose a default region
});
```


```python Python
import asyncio
from blaxel.core import SandboxInstance

async def main():

    # Create sandbox if it doesn't exist
    sandbox = await SandboxInstance.create_if_not_exists({
      "name": "my-sandbox",
      "image": "blaxel/base-image:latest",   # public or custom image
      "memory": 4096,   # in MB
      "ports": [{ "target": 3000 }],   # optional; ports to expose
      "labels": {"env": "dev", "project": "my-project"},  # optional; labels
      "region": "us-pdx-1"   # optional; if not specified, Blaxel will choose a default region
    })

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

</CodeGroup>

### Using the CLI and Console

Although less common, it is also possible to create a sandbox via the Blaxel CLI or the Blaxel Console.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="CLI">
    ```shell
    bl new sandbox my-sandbox
    cd my-sandbox
    bl deploy
    ```

    This command initializes a new sandbox project and configuration file in the named directory `my-sandbox` and then deploys the sandbox on Blaxel.

    The project directory contains the Blaxel configuration file `blaxel.toml`, which can be further customized to suit your sandbox deployment requirements, by modifying the base image, memory, environment, etc. [`Learn more about the blaxel.toml file`](/deployment-reference).

    <Tip>
      Running `bl deploy` here also saves the image to be reused later as a template.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Console">
    - Log in to the [Blaxel Console](https://app.blaxel.ai/).
    - Click **Sandboxes** in the left navigation menu.
    - Click **\+Create sandbox** -\> **Deploy from console**.
    - Select an image template.
    - On the next page, configure the sandbox resources, including memory, time-to-live and region.
    - Click **Next** to proceed.
    - On the next page, reconfirm the sandbox parameters. Click **Create** to create the sandbox.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Understand sandbox configuration

### Images

<Info>
  The list of public images [can be found here](https://github.com/blaxel-ai/sandbox/tree/main/hub). To create a sandbox with one of those images, enter `blaxel/{NAME}:latest` (e.g. _blaxel/nextjs:latest_).
</Info>

[Custom sandbox images](Templates) (or _templates_) enable you to create sandboxes with a consistent, customized set of tools, configurations, or entrypoint scripts.

### Memory and filesystem

For maximum performance, Blaxel sandboxes store part of their filesystem in memory. The base of the filesystem (the user-supplied image) is stored as read-only files on host storage using a highly-efficient format called [EROFS (Extendable Read-Only File System)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EROFS). On top of the read-only base, a writable layer lives entirely in the sandbox's RAM using `tmpfs`. [OverlayFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OverlayFS) serves as orchestrator, directing reads to the EROFS base and writes to the in-memory `tmpfs` filesystem.

Due to this, Blaxel sandboxes reserve, when possible, approximately 50% of the available memory for the `tmpfs` filesystem. More information on our implementation is available in this [blog post](https://blaxel.ai/blog/how-to-slash-sandbox-memory-usage-by-75-using-overlayfs).

To avoid out-of-memory errors or if additional storage is required, one option is to add storage using [volumes](/Sandboxes/Volumes). However, this requires deleting and recreating the sandbox first. In addition, volumes are not as fast as the native in-memory filesystem.

### Ports

The following ports are reserved by Blaxel's system:

- **443**: This port hosts the main [sandbox API](https://docs.blaxel.ai/api-reference/filesystem/get-file-or-directory-information) and is exposed via HTTPS
- **80**: Reserved for system operations
- **8080**: Reserved for sandbox API functionality

You can expose specific non-reserved ports [**when creating a new sandbox**](Overview) by using the `ports` parameter. This allows you to access these ports from outside the sandbox, typically to create a [preview URL](Preview-url) on them.

### Regions

Select the [region](../Infrastructure/Regions) where you want to deploy your sandbox. If you don't specify a region, Blaxel will automatically use a default region.

### Labels

You can also add optional labels for sandboxes. Labels are specified as key-value pairs during sandbox creation.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
// Create a new sandbox
const sandbox = await SandboxInstance.create({
  name: "my-sandbox",
  image: "blaxel/base-image:latest",   // public or custom image
  memory: 4096,   // in MB
  labels: { env: "dev", project: "my-project" }, // optional; labels
  region: "us-pdx-1"   // optional; if not specified, Blaxel will choose a default region
});
```


```python Python
# Create a new sandbox
sandbox = await SandboxInstance.create({
  "name": "my-sandbox",
  "image": "blaxel/base-image:latest",   # public or custom image
  "memory": 4096,   # in MB
  "labels": {"env": "dev", "project": "my-project"},  # optional; labels
  "region": "us-pdx-1"   # optional; if not specified, Blaxel will choose a default region
})
```

</CodeGroup>

You can use these labels for filtering sandboxes in the Blaxel CLI or Blaxel Console:

```shell
# Get sandboxes with specific label (e.g., env=dev)
bl get sandboxes -o json | jq -r '.[] | select(.metadata.labels.env == "dev") | .metadata.name'
```

### Expiration

Blaxel supports [automatic sandbox deletion](./Expiration) based on specific conditions.

## Retrieve an existing sandbox

To reconnect to an existing sandbox, simply provide its name:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
import { SandboxInstance } from "@blaxel/core";

// Connect to existing sandbox
const sandbox = await SandboxInstance.get("my-sandbox");
```


```python Python
from blaxel.core import SandboxInstance

# Connect to existing sandbox
sandbox = await SandboxInstance.get("my-sandbox")
```

</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  Complete code examples demonstrating all operations are available on Blaxel's GitHub: [in TypeScript](https://github.com/blaxel-ai/sdk-typescript/tree/main/tests/sandbox) and [in Python](https://github.com/blaxel-ai/sdk-python/tree/main/tests/integration/sandbox).
</Tip>

## Delete a sandbox

<Important>
  When you delete a sandbox, all data is immediately erased. If the sandbox was never in standby mode, Blaxel guarantees ZDR (zero data retention).
</Important>

Delete a sandbox by calling:

- the class-level `delete()` method with the sandbox `name` as argument, or

  <CodeGroup>

  ```typescript TypeScript
  import { SandboxInstance } from "@blaxel/core";

  // Delete sandbox using class-level method
  await SandboxInstance.delete("my-sandbox");
  ```


  ```python Python
  from blaxel.core import SandboxInstance

  # Delete sandbox using class-level method
  await SandboxInstance.delete("my-sandbox")
  ```

  </CodeGroup>
- by calling the instance-level `delete()` method:

  <CodeGroup>

  ```typescript TypeScript
  import { SandboxInstance } from "@blaxel/core";

  // Get existing sandbox
  const sandbox = await SandboxInstance.get("my-sandbox");

  // Delete sandbox using instance-level method
  await sandbox.delete()
  ```


  ```python Python
  from blaxel.core import SandboxInstance

  # Get existing sandbox
  sandbox = await SandboxInstance.get("my-sandbox")

  # Delete sandbox using instance-level method
  await sandbox.delete()
  ```

  </CodeGroup>

## Upgrade a sandbox's API

Every Blaxel sandbox includes a [custom API binary](./Templates#how-sandbox-templates-work), which is necessary for sandbox functionality like process management and file operations. It is possible to perform an in-place upgrade of this API without needing to recreate or restart the sandbox.

<Note>
  This feature is currently in beta and only available for sandboxes built or created with sandbox API v0.2.0 or later (sandboxes created after 2 Feb 2026). For sandboxes built or created earlier than this date/API version, in-place upgrade is not possible; the sandbox must be recreated to obtain the new API.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
import { SandboxInstance } from "@blaxel/core";

// Connect to existing sandbox
const sandbox = await SandboxInstance.get("my-sandbox")

// Upgrade sandbox API to "latest"
await sandbox.system.upgrade({ version: "latest" })
```


```python Python
from blaxel.core import SandboxInstance

# Connect to existing sandbox
sandbox = await SandboxInstance.get("my-sandbox")

# Upgrade sandbox API to "latest"
await sandbox.system.upgrade(version="latest")
```

</CodeGroup>

You can find a list of available API versions in [Blaxel's public repository](https://github.com/blaxel-ai/sandbox/).

## Connect to a sandbox with an interactive terminal

You can explore the contents of a sandbox with an interactive terminal. You can access this terminal in two ways:

- From the Blaxel Console, by visiting the detail page for your sandbox in your web browser and selecting the **Terminal** tab:

  ![image.png](Overview/connect-web-terminal.png)
- From your local host, by running:

  ```bash
  bl connect sandbox your-sandbox-name
  ```

  ![image.png](Overview/connect-terminal.png)


## Sandbox statuses

Blaxel sandboxes go from standby to active in **under 25 milliseconds**, and scale back down to standby **after a few seconds of inactivity**, maintaining their previous state after scaling down.

- In STANDBY mode: You are not charged for CPU/memory while a sandbox is in standby mode. However, you are charged for the storage of the snapshot and/or the volumes.
- In ACTIVE mode: You are charged for CPU/memory and storage while a sandbox is in active mode. Sandboxes automatically return to standby mode after 1 second of inactivity.

The **scale-to-zero functionality is based on network activity.** When your connection to the sandbox closes, Blaxel automatically creates a snapshot of the entire state (including the complete file system in memory, preserving both files and running processes) and transitions to standby mode within approximately 5 seconds.

Any running processes are included in this snapshot and will be **instantly restored** when you reconnect to the sandbox.

The possible sandbox statuses are:

- `UPLOADING`: A new sandbox version has just been uploaded; the build has not started yet.
- `BUILDING`: A new sandbox version has been uploaded and the build is in progress.
- `DEPLOYING`: The sandbox deployment is in progress.
- `DEPLOYED`: The sandbox is ready to use.
- `FAILED`: An error occurred during the build or deployment of the sandbox.
- `TERMINATED`: A TTL was set for the sandbox; it has been deleted and will be removed from the API/UI soon.
- `DELETING`: A deletion request has been triggered and the deletion is in progress.

<Note>
  `UPLOADING/BUILDING` statuses only appear when using `bl deploy` from a sandbox template folder.
