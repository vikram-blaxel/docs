title: 'Integrate in your apps'

description: 'Integrate and use Blaxel agents in your applications and communication platforms.'

---

An agent deployed on Blaxel can be consumed through various downstream applications, including web apps and front-end UIs.

## Integrate in your application

You’ll need:

- An **API key**: generate an [API key for a service account in your workspace](../Security/Service-accounts). Permissions will be scoped to the permissions given to the service account.
- The [**inference URL**](Query-agents) for the agent.

Use these code snippets to integrate your agent in your JavaScript, TypeScript or Python applications.

<Warning>Make sure to not expose your API key publicly.</Warning>

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch("https://run.blaxel.ai/YOUR-WORKSPACE/agents/YOUR-AGENT", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": `Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>`
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    inputs: "Hello, world!"
  })
});

const data = await response.text();
console.log(data);

```

```typescript TypeScript

const response = await fetch("https://run.blaxel.ai/YOUR-WORKSPACE/agents/YOUR-AGENT", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": `Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>`
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    inputs: "Hello, world!"
  })
});

const data: string = await response.text();
console.log(data);

```
```python Python

import requests

response = requests.post(
    "https://run.blaxel.ai/YOUR-WORKSPACE/agents/YOUR-AGENT",
    headers={
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>"
    },
    json={
        "inputs": "Hello, world!"
    }
)

data = response.text
print(data)

```
