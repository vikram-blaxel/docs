Blaxel Agents Hosting lets you bring your agent code **and deploys it as a serverless auto-scalable endpoint** — no matter your development framework.

An *AI agent* is any application that leverages generative AI models to take autonomous actions in the real world. These agents often require computing power to execute their interactions.

## Essentials

Agents Hosting is a **serverless computing service that allows you to host any application** without having to manage infrastructure. It gives you full observability and tracing out of the box.

It doesn't force you into any kind of workflow or shaped box — you can host any app on Blaxel as long as it exposes an HTTP API. This makes Blaxel completely agnostic of the framework used to develop your workflow or agent.

Blaxel optimizes the experience specifically for agentic AI use cases, delivering a fully serverless experience even for the longer-running tasks typical of AI agents. For example, telemetry focuses on crucial agent metrics like end-to-end latency and time-to-first-token.

### Main features

Some features of running workloads on Agents Hosting:

- a default invocation endpoint for synchronous requests
- an asynchronous invocation endpoint, for agent workloads lasting from dozens of seconds to 10 minutes
- full logging, telemetry and tracing — out-of-the-box
- revisions manage your agents’ lifecycle across iterations. You can ship as a new revision and rollback instantly
- an SDK to connect to other Blaxel resources (like [models](../Models/Overview) and [tools](../Functions/Overview)) with adapters to most popular [agent frameworks](../Tutorials/Agents-Overview)

### Requirements & limitations

Agents Hosting have few requirements or limitations:

- Agents Hosting only supports applications developed in **Python** and in **TypeScript**.

- The only requirement to deploy an app on Agents Hosting is that it exposes an HTTP API server which is bound on `HOST` (for the host) and `PORT` (for the port). **These two environment variables are required for the host+port combo.**
    - You can use [express](https://expressjs.com/), [fastify](https://fastify.dev/), [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), etc. for this.

- Deployed agents have a runtime limit after which executions time out. The maximum timeout is 15 minutes.

- The synchronous endpoint has a timeout of **100 seconds** for keeping the connection open when no data flows through the API. If your agent streams back responses, the 100-second timeout resets with each chunk streamed. For example, if your agent processes a request for 5 minutes while streaming data, the connection stays open. However, if it goes 100 seconds without sending any data — even while calling external APIs — the connection will timeout.

## Deploy your agent to Blaxel

[Blaxel SDK](../sdk-reference/introduction) provides methods to programmatically access and integrate various resources hosted on Blaxel into your agent's code, such as: [model APIs](../Models/Overview), [tool servers](../Functions/Overview), [sandboxes](../Sandboxes/Overview), [batch jobs](../Jobs/Overview), or [other agents](Overview). The SDK handles authentication, secure connection management and telemetry automatically.

This packaging makes Blaxel **fully agnostic of the framework** used to develop your agent and doesn’t prevent you from deploying your software on another platform.

## Use your agents in your apps

Once your agent is deployed on Blaxel, you can start using it in your applications.

Whether you need to process individual inference requests or integrate the agent into a larger application workflow, **Blaxel provides flexible options for interaction**. Learn how to authenticate requests, handle responses, and optimize your agent's performance in production environments.
