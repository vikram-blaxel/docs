Blaxel features a SDK in two languages: **Python and TypeScript**. Check out down below the installation instructions, as well as documentation on **how the SDK** **authenticates** to Blaxel.

## How authentication works

The Blaxel SDK authenticates with your workspace using credentials from these sources, in priority order:

1. when running on Blaxel, authentication is handled automatically
2. variables in your `.env` file (`BL_WORKSPACE` and `BL_API_KEY`, or see [this page](../Agents/Variables-and-secrets) for other authentication options).
3. environment variables from your machine
4. configuration file created locally when you log in through [Blaxel CLI](../cli-reference/introduction) (or deploy on Blaxel)

When developing locally, the recommended method is to just **log in to your workspace with Blaxel CLI.** This allows you to run Blaxel SDK functions that will automatically connect to your workspace without additional setup. When you deploy on Blaxel, this connection persists automatically.

When running Blaxel SDK from a remote server that is not Blaxel-hosted, we recommend using environment variables as described in the third option above.
