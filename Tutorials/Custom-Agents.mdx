Blaxel’s development paradigm is designed to have a minimal footprint on your usual development process.

Your custom code remains platform-agnostic: you can deploy it on Blaxel or through traditional methods like Docker containers on VMs or Kubernetes clusters. When you deploy on Blaxel (CLI command `bl deploy`), Blaxel runs a specialized build process that integrates your code with its [Global Agentics Network](../Infrastructure/Global-Inference-Network) features.

<Warning>
  At this time, Blaxel only supports custom agents developed in TypeScript or Python.

Here is a high-level overview of how agents can be built and deployed using Blaxel:

1. **Initialize a new project by creating a local git repository**. This will contain your agent's logic and connections, as well as all required dependencies. For quick setup, use [Blaxel CLI](../cli-reference/introduction) command `bl new agent`, which creates a pre-scaffolded local repository ready for development that you can deploy to Blaxel in one command.
2. **Develop and test your agent iteratively in a local environment**.
    1. Develop your agent logic however you want (using an agentic framework or any custom TypeScript/Python code). Write your own functions as needed. Use Blaxel SDK commands to connect to resources from Blaxel such as model APIs and tool servers.
    2. Use Blaxel CLI command `bl serve` to serve your agent on your local machine. The execution workflow—including agent logic, functions, and model API calls—is broken down and sandboxed exactly as it would be when served on Blaxel.
3. **Deploy your agent**. Use Blaxel CLI command `bl deploy` to build and deploy your agent on Blaxel. You can manage a development & production life-cycle by deploying multiple agents, with the according prefix or label.
